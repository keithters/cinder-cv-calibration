* OpenCv Samples

This directory contains examples for testing the board detection capability of the aruco library.
It contains the following files:
 - video.avi: video that shows a board
 - intrinsics.yml: intrinsic information of the camera in the OpenCv format
 - board_pix.yml: configuration of the board shown in the video. It contains the id of the markers in the boards as well as its arrangement in pixels
 - board_meters.yml:same as before, but in meters
 - board.png: printable image of the board
 - image-test.png: a sample image



In order to test the library with these files you can use :

- aruco_simple_board: the simplest example. 
      Run it as:  > aruco_simple_board image-test.png board_pix.yml intrinsics.yml 0.039
	  or
       > aruco_simple_board image-test.png board_meters.yml intrinsics.yml 

- aruco_test_board: a more sohpisticated example 
     Run it as:  > aruco_test_board    video.avi    board_pix.yml  intrinsics.yml 0.039
	   or    > aruco_test_board    video.avi    board_meters.yml  intrinsics.yml 
- aruco_test_board_gl: example showing how to use OpenGL
     Run it as: > aruco_test_board_gl   video.avi   board_pix.yml   intrinsics.yml  0.039
	  or    > aruco_test_board_gl   video.avi   board_meters.yml   intrinsics.yml



Enjoy!
